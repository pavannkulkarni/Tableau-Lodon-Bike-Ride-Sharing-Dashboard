# Lodon-Bike-Ride-Sharing-Dashboard

# Tools Used:
Excel
Tableau
Python

# Dashboard Summary
The dashboard presents two complementary views:

Time Series Analysis: 
8-week moving average of bike rides over time with interactive controls

Environmental Correlation: 
Heat map showing the relationship between temperature, wind speed, and bike usage

# Key Insights: 
Temporal Patterns
Seasonal Cycling Behavior:

Peak Season: Summer months (June-August) show the highest usage, reaching ~250k rides in the 8-week moving average
Low Season: Winter months (December-February) drop to ~125k rides - roughly half of summer usage
Growth Trend: There's a notable upward trend from early 2015 through mid-2015, suggesting growing adoption

Interactive Period Analysis:

The highlighted green period (April-June 2015) shows rapid growth from ~150k to ~250k rides
This represents the transition from spring to summer when cycling becomes more appealing

Weather Impact on Cycling
The heat map reveals fascinating patterns about how environmental conditions affect bike usage:
Optimal Cycling Conditions:

Sweet Spot: 10-15°C with moderate wind speeds (7-18 kph) shows the highest usage
Peak Usage: The darkest cells indicate 100k+ rides occur most frequently at:

12.5°C with 10-18 kph wind
14.9°C with 7-14 kph wind

Weather Barriers:

Extreme Temperatures: Very low (<5°C) and high (>20°C) temperatures reduce ridership
High Wind Impact: Wind speeds above 25 kph significantly decrease usage regardless of temperature
Calm Conditions: Surprisingly, very low wind speeds (0-3 kph) don't show peak usage, suggesting light breeze is preferred

Business Implications
Seasonal Planning:

The 2x difference between summer and winter usage suggests need for seasonal capacity adjustments
Winter maintenance windows could be optimized during low-usage periods

Weather-Based Operations:

Predictive models could use the temperature/wind relationship to forecast daily demand
Marketing campaigns could target the optimal weather windows (10-15°C, moderate wind)

Growth Opportunities:

The steady growth trend through 2015 suggests successful market penetration
The sharp seasonal variations indicate potential for weather-resistant usage strategies

This dashboard effectively demonstrates how external factors dramatically influence urban mobility patterns, providing actionable insights for operational planning and strategic decision-making in bike-sharing systems.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
